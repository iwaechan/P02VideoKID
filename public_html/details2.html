            <h2 class="details-header">Cuphead</h2>
            <p class="AboutPara">Cuphead is a run and gun indie video game developed and
              published by StudioMDHR Entertainment. As the titular character Cuphead,
              the player fights a series of bosses in order to repay a debt to the devil.
              The game was heavily inspired by the works of 1930s cartoonists such as Max
              Fleischer's Fleischer Studios, and sought to keep the works' subversive and
              surrealist qualities.</p>

            <h2 class="details-header">Plot:</h2>
            <p class="AboutPara">On the fictional Inkwell Isle, Cuphead and his brother Mugman are two fun-loving kids who live under the watchful eye of Elder Kettle. Against the elder's warnings, the brothers wander into the Devil's Casino run by King Dice and play craps. When the brothers go on a winning streak, the casino's manager King Dice calls upon the Devil who raises the stakes. If Cuphead and Mugman can win another time, they would own the entire casino. If not, the Devil would have their souls. Cuphead rolls snake eyes and he and Mugman must give up their souls. The brothers beg for mercy, so the Devil makes a deal with them: collect the contracts of the other inhabitants of Inkwell Isle who have lost their souls until midnight in the next day and he might let the brothers off the hook. They visit the Elder Kettle who gives them a potion that allows them to fire blasts from their fingers to aid in their quest.</p>

            <h2 class="details-header">Gameplay:</h2>

            <p class="AboutPara">Cuphead is a run and gun game, features a branching level sequence and is based around continuous boss fights. Cuphead has infinite lives and keeps weapons between deaths, and can continuously fire his blasts and has a quick dash ability that can be used at will. The player can also purchase more weapons and "Charms" from the shop using coins collected from the run-and-gun levels. </p>
