            <p class="AboutPara">The Evil Within 2 is a third-person survival horror
            video game developed by Tango Gameworks and published by Bethesda Softworks
            for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. The game was released worldwide
            in October 2017 and is the sequel to the 2014 video game The Evil Within.</p>

            <h2 class="details-header">Plot:</h2>
            <p class="AboutPara">Three years after the events at Beacon Mental Hospital, Sebastian Castellanos has left the Krimson City Police Department and continues to be haunted by his experiences at Beacon, the disappearance of his wife Myra, and the death of his daughter Lily in a house fire. Sebastian is then approached by former partner and Mobius agent Juli Kidman, who reveals to him that Lily is still alive since Mobius faked her death. However, Mobius now needs Sebastian's help in saving her. Sebastian is brought to a secret Mobius facility where he meets the Administrator, who further explains that Lily is being used as the Core for a new STEM system to simulate an idyllic town called Union. However, some time ago, Mobius lost contact with Lily and their agents inside Union, and they no longer have any control over the STEM. Sebastian reluctantly agrees to help Mobius so that he has a chance to save Lily and enters the STEM. </p>

            <h2 class="details-header">Gameplay:</h2>

            <p class="AboutPara">Similar to its predecessor, the game is a survival horror game. Played from a third-person perspective, the player assumes control of detective Sebastian Castellanos, who must descend into the world of Union to rescue his daughter, Lily. There are three difficulty modes, namely Casual, Survival, and Nightmare. In The Evil Within 2, maps are larger and there are multiple ways for players to advance in a level. The player is also given an item known as "The Communicator", which helps to highlight the objectives, resources, and enemies featured in the game's world. </p>
